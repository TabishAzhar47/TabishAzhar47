Bridging the gap between bits and boards! ⚙️✨

> “Turning silicon into solutions, one circuit at a time.” 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub lab! 🧪 Where firmware meets hardware in perfect harmony. I’m Tabish Azhar, an Embedded Systems Engineer who designs both the brains and the bones of tomorrow’s devices. From low-level firmware to PCB layouts, I make sure every project hums with efficiency and precision.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
- End-to-end IoT prototype: STM32 + ESP32 firmware with AWS cloud integration  
- High-speed PCB design for next-gen sensor modules using Altium Designer  

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Advanced FPGA architectures with Vivado & Questasim  
- Hardware-software co-simulation in MATLAB  

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Open-source RTOS drivers  
- FPGA-accelerated signal processing projects  

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- Ultra-low-power design optimization  
- Formal verification for critical firmware loops  

### 💬 Ask me about
- C/C++ firmware development on STM32, ESP32, Puya, ATmel, PIC  
- PCB design workflows in Altium, KiCad, EasyEDA  
- Verilog & VHDL IP core development
